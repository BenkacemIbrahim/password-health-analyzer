# Code of Conduct

## Our commitment

We are committed to making participation in this project a respectful, harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions.
- Focus feedback on code and outcomes, not people.
- Welcome different perspectives and experience levels.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.
- Publishing private information without consent.
- Repeated disruptive or bad-faith interactions.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this policy. They may remove or edit content, reject contributions, or restrict participation for behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting

Report incidents privately by opening a security/contact issue with minimal public detail, then notifying maintainers directly if contact details are available in repository settings.
